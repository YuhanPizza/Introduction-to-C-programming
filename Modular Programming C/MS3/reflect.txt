Q1. 
// Index for Lowest Date and Time
int getIndexForLowestDateTime(struct Appointment*, int);
This function accepts an address of a struct Appointment and an int max 
appointments. This functions have multiple loops to check each variable 
of the struct Appointment appointments array.It checks if it is the 
lowest year, lowest month, lowest day, lowest hour and lowest min. and if it is,
It stores the value of that struct in the provided int valriables. lowestYear,
lowestMonth,lowestDay,lowestHour,lowestMin; It does it in a loop so 
that it can check very variable in the appointments struct array. 

// Sort Appointments
void sortAppointments(struct Appointment* , int);
This function also accepts a struct and an int that represents all 
the data recieved in the importAppointments function. This function sorts 
the functions given from lowest to highiest calling in the function 
getIndexForLowestDateTime in a loop calling it multiple times till all the 
appointments have been sorted.

// Check for Available appointments
int availAppoint(struct Appointment*, int);
This function receives appointment and maxappointments.The purpose of this function
is to check if there are available slots for appointments to be made and then checks 
if there is a slot and returns that slots index, else it returns a -1 representing that
there was no more space for more appointments.

All three of this functions are important soo that the data variables will be sorted 
in accordance to the required output.

Q2.
void addAppointment(struct Appointment*, int,struct Patient*, int);
This function has over 88 lines of code. It saved me around 30 lines of code, this function
was created to address the display/input of the day based on the year (leap check) and the 
months with specific days. These logic/conditions were identified in 2 functions, when displaying 
filtered data and when adding a new appointment. By placing this function in its own module and
then run pass these 2 functions, the readability of the code was improved along with the lines saves.
availAppoint function was also called inside this function saving lines of code, checking if there
was more space to add into the appointments.

By using this approach when writing code it allows locating problems and debug more local by correct 
them within its own function, without compromising the whole code. The changes to these modules 
will be applied to all the code, meaning that in terms of scalability, these functions can and will
be used multiple times for new features and in case these functions need an update or even when replacing,
this processes will be carried out in a more efficient manner. Coding this functions must be carried 
out with extreme finess and attention to detail, since they could cause errors, bugs or crashes in the 
whole program.

Q3.
Time Management is essential to any project/activity, by properly allocating time you become more efficient
overall. Considering that we have deadlines not only on this subject but other subjects aswell, Also having 
proficient amount of time to relax and unwind also prevents you from burnout. Mindfulness is also a great way 
of being efficient and being able to discern if you are under a lot of stress.Mindfulness is helpful in the moment of
learning and also in more future-focused skills. By maintaining a calmer view of the present, students
are able to improve their study habits, planning, andorganizational skills through mindfulness. Speaking of 
I usually spent my week attending class and using 1 hr of my break inbetween classes to focus and have a head start
of deadlines for that class. Although when I have a day off or a lot of free time i spend 2 hrs working on my class
deadlines in rotation with a proper alotted time to relax to avoid burnout. So I can start my Project with a lot 
more focus. Whenever I get stuck on something I tend to pull out my notes while listening to the lecture. So I can pin 
point which part of the lesson plan I need to focus on to understand the concept in the class that I need to learn more
about to be able to solve my doubts. Overall I have learned alot from this Assignment.
