Dear Mr.Herman,

I am writing as a concerned parent regarding your decision to allow students to use smartphones in the classroom. I anderstand as we enter this new age of technology you as a principal
a thinking of better ways to help mold young minds. But as a parent I have my doubts on whether it is used by the students properly. I have two issues with this implementation.
the first being if it can cause my kids to loose focus when in class, and two wheather it is used appropriatley. Seeing as smartphones can be used to google anything nowadays they might 
think paying attention in class is not worth it, or if they were to use it to play videogames in class. But I do understand the reasons for your implementation that smartphones be used 
in class. A recent article I have read stated "Itâ€™s hard to think of a real-world challenge where you are placed in silent isolation with paper and pen, left to rely exclusively on memory."
(Brown, 2011) While I do understand that at this day and age everything is at our fingertips and why should we not allow our kids to use all the tools they have at hand. I still would 
like a more controlled approach to your new implementation of using smartphones in class.

Thank you and God bless.

Kind Regards,
Lorenz Alvin Tubo
Parent
