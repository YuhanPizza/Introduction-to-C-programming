1. If and Switch
IF SELECTION CONSTRUCT
if (nMonth == 11)
{
   printf("*** Log date set! ***\n");
   printf("\n%d-NOV-0%d\n", nYear, nDays);
}
if else (nMonth == 12)
{
   printf("*** Log date set! ***\n");
   printf("\n%d-DEC-0%d\n", nYear, nDays);
}
SWITCH SELECTION CONSTRUCT
switch (nMonth)
{
case 11:
    printf("\n*** Log date set! ***\n\nLog starting date: %d-NOV-0%d\n", nYear, nDays);
    break;
case 12:
    printf("\n*** Log date set! ***\n\nLog starting date: %d-DEC-0%d\n", nYear, nDays);
    break;
}
2. for, while and, do-while
for loop.because this loop executes is code while the condition is true. It sets up the default value, 
condition and increments the variable used per rotation/repetition and checks again. 
for(i=0; i < LOG_DAYS; i++), thus it is easy to control how many times it goes around the loop.

3. Syntactic Error = for this type of error it usually does not let you run your program
it gives you an error message and gives you the location of the error. First i read the error
message and try to understand it best as i could. try to fix the error and recompile until 
it matches my desired output.

Semantic Error = for this error the program does not give me an error message and it will still 
compile, during these types of errors the program does not give you the desired output. In order
to fix these errors. every statement in the program must be checked. In order to check the program
I must issue break points on where i think the error is and then slowly monitor every step over 
while checking the values of variables on the program or checking the conditions/logic of the
program.
